# ChatGPT
A browser-based AI chatbot built using WebLLM, allowing users to run a large language model directly in the web browser â€” no server required. This project demonstrates how to integrate WebLLM into a simple chat interface to provide interactive, ChatGPT-style conversations without sending data to external servers.
